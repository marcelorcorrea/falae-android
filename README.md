# Falaê

Falaê is an Android app developed by HP volunteers from Brazil R&D in
partnership with the NGO Educandário – Centro de Reabilitação São João
Batista. It is an Alternative Communication app, that allows people with
speech and mobility impairments to communicate by using pictures that
represent words (verbs, nouns, adjectives…).
