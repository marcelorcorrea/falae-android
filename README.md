# Falaê

Falaê is an Android app developed by HP volunteers from Brazil R&D in
partnership with the NGO Educandário – Centro de Reabilitação São João
Batista. It is an Alternative Communication app, that allows people with
speech and mobility impairments to communicate by using pictures that
represent words (verbs, nouns, adjectives…).

Falaê consists of two parts: Android app and the web platform. The web page is used for user registering. Once registered, the user can customize their profile, as well as create and modify communication boards, pages and items. The Android app connects to the web platform in order to sincronize the user's data.

This repository consists in the Android App.
